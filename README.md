## Demo
https://github.com/Daniel-Brai/Atomic/assets/88239970/09d79bbe-fa19-4b0b-9163-d24ea783fb81

## Requirements
1. Node >= 18 LTS
2. Sqlite3
3. Docker >= 19
4. Redis >= 3.6
5. Nginx 1.20.3


## Future Todos
1. Add Redis Storage Backend for un-utilized Bloom Filter Algorithm and switch out Base 62 used for Hashing the unique 16 bit numeric id generated by the Ticket Server Algorithm
2. Enable partial page updates for unauthenticated with an atomic list created so it is added to the list of his/her links without refresh with Websockets (WS) or Server Sent Events (SSE) 

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your system using https with the command: `git clone https://github.com/Atomic.git`
2. On a terminal session in the root directory of the project, run the command: `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies
3. Export the environment variables in the root directory of the project or create a `.env` file to it :
- `DB_SYNC`
- `DB_LOGGING`
- `REDIS_HOST`
- `REDIS_PORT`
- `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`

**Note**: In both `DB_SYNC` and `DB_LOGGING` should be set to False.
4. After passing the environment variables, run the project with the comman: `npm run start:dev` 

## Deployment
1. Using a PAAS or CAASS, and set the environment variables
2. Using Docker
- With Docker running, build the atomic application image with a tag using the command: `docker build -t atomic`
**Note**, Redis and Nginx aren't in the dockerfile so you have add them manually or using the docker image
